to make queries:
./main.py
enter a query when prompted or type q to quit


algorithm for eveluating queries:
user input it gathered
A recursive parseing function called rec_parse is used.  It takes a string and
returns either None or a list of tuples of the form (query_type, val)

The function goes through trying to eveluate the string as all the query types (mode, date, etc)
If the begining or entire string evaluates as one of the types, then the function calls itself on the 
remaining substring, appending the (query_type, val) to the list returned from the recursive call
the base case for the function is when string length is 0
